# Resources
## Software Libraries
### MediaPipe
MediaPipe is used for real-time pose estimation. It tracks and analyzes the user's body posture during various activities, such as sitting, yoga, and gym exercises. By detecting key points on the body, MediaPipe helps in identifying improper postures and provides data for corrective feedback.

### OpenCV
OpenCV is utilized for image and video analysis. It processes the input from cameras or videos to detect and recognize the user's body movements. OpenCV works in tandem with MediaPipe to enhance the accuracy of posture detection and to preprocess the video feed, such as background subtraction and noise reduction.

### TensorFlow & Keras
TensorFlow and Keras are used for developing and training machine learning models that classify and predict posture quality. These models analyze the data provided by MediaPipe and OpenCV to determine if the user's posture is correct or needs adjustment. TensorFlow's deep learning capabilities enable the creation of robust models that improve over time with more data.

### Customized Version of C++ for Arduino
The customized version of C++ for Arduino is used to develop firmware for hardware components, such as wearable devices or posture correction gadgets. These devices provide haptic or visual feedback to the user when an incorrect posture is detected. Arduino's efficient handling of limited memory and processing power makes it suitable for real-time posture correction applications.
## Hardware Components
### Arduino
Arduino provides a user-friendly platform for programming and controlling hardware components like LEDs. Its simple IDE and beginner-friendly programming language make it accessible even to those with limited electronics experience.
In our project, Arduino is used to control the hardware components of the posture correction device. It processes input from sensors and provides feedback through LEDs or other actuators. Arduino's ease of use allows for quick prototyping and iteration of the posture correction system
### Type A to Type B USB Connector
The Type A to Type B USB connector is used to establish a connection between the posture correction wristband and the computer. This connection allows for data transfer between the wristband sensors and the software running on the computer, enabling real-time posture monitoring and feedback.
### LEDs
In our project, LEDs serve as visual indicators for the user. One LED lights up to confirm that data from the sensors is being received correctly. The other LED provides feedback on the user's posture, turning on or changing color to signal when the posture is correct or needs adjustment. This immediate visual feedback helps users make necessary corrections in real-time.

# DataCollection
### Gym Pose Dataset
To develop a robust gym pose detection model, we collected a dataset of 280 gym pose images. Each image captures both the initial and final stages of various gym poses. These images were labeled by the specific pose they depict. 

To enhance the dataset and improve the model's generalization, we used the Python library `imgaug` for data augmentation. Each image was augmented twelve times using the following techniques:
- Tilting (5° left and right)
- Adding Gaussian noise
- Blurring
- Distorting
- Flipping horizontally

This augmentation process resulted in a dataset of 3360 unique samples, significantly expanding the original dataset and providing diverse training data for the model.

### Yoga Pose Dataset
For the yoga pose detection model, we started with a collection of 306 images. These images were labeled by pose, with each sequence of images representing a specific yoga pose (e.g., images 1-13 show Anjaneyasana, 14-25 show Virabhadrasana, etc.).

To augment this dataset, we again used the `imgaug` library. Each image was augmented six times using the following techniques:
- Tilting (5° left and right)
- Adding Gaussian noise
- Blurring
- Distorting
- Flipping horizontally

This augmentation resulted in a dataset of 2142 unique samples, increasing the variety of training examples and enhancing the model's ability to accurately detect different yoga poses.

### Slouch Detection
The slouch detection system operates in real-time and does not rely on any predefined model or dataset. Consequently, there was no need for data augmentation for this aspect of the project. The system uses live data to detect and correct slouching, providing immediate feedback to the user.

# ModelTraining

To develop our pose detection models, we employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture consisting of 4 convolutional layers and 3 dense layers. Additional layers, such as flattening and MaxPooling2D, were incorporated to create a complex neural connection between the input images, allowing the model to identify patterns in the testing data, which is real-time data.

### Model Architecture

The following code snippet demonstrates the architecture of the CNN used for both the gym pose and yoga pose detection models:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the model architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Reshape((33, 2, 1), input_shape=(33, 2)),  # Reshape the input data
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same'),  # First Conv2D layer
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same'),  # Second Conv2D layer
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),  # MaxPooling2D layer
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same'),  # Third Conv2D layer
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', padding='same'),  # Fourth Conv2D layer
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),  # Flatten layer
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),  # First Dense layer
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),  # Second Dense layer
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(21, activation='softmax')  # Output Dense layer with 21 classes
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(poses, labels, epochs=100, batch_size=32)
```

### Explanation of Layers

- **Reshape Layer:** Reshapes the input data to match the required input shape for the convolutional layers.
- **Conv2D Layers:** Apply convolution operations with 32 and 64 filters, using ReLU activation and 'same' padding. These layers help the model to learn spatial hierarchies in the images.
- **MaxPooling2D Layer:** Reduces the spatial dimensions of the data, which helps in down-sampling and reduces the computational complexity.
- **Flatten Layer:** Flattens the 2D matrix data into a 1D vector, preparing it for the dense layers.
- **Dense Layers:** Fully connected layers with ReLU activation. The final dense layer uses a softmax activation function to output probabilities for each class (pose).

### Model Training

The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, `sparse_categorical_crossentropy` loss function, and accuracy as the evaluation metric. It is then trained on the augmented dataset for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32.

### Real-Time Pose Detection

As the user attempts poses in front of the camera, the live feed is detected by OpenCV using the system’s webcam. OpenCV, a popular computer vision library in Python, captures the live video stream. This information is then fed to MediaPipe, another well-known image detection library, to extract keypoints of the person, such as major joints. These keypoints are connected and compared to the trained model, which evaluates and displays how accurately the poses are executed.


# ArduinoWristband
The Arduino wristband is a versatile and user-friendly device designed to aid individuals in maintaining proper posture during various activities. The wristband features two LEDs, each serving a distinct purpose to enhance user experience and functionality. LED1 acts as a data input indicator, blinking continuously during real-time video capture to reassure the wearer that data is actively being collected. This visual cue boosts confidence in the device's operation.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c4b07de-554b-4d0c-9959-8343320b5420)

Meanwhile, LED2 functions as an output feedback indicator, alerting the user to instances of inaccurate posture. Through integrated sensors and algorithms, the wristband detects deviations from the desired posture, prompting LED2 to blink and notifying the wearer to make necessary adjustments. This immediate feedback mechanism is crucial for real-time posture correction.

The wristband is built using an Arduino board, which controls the LEDs and processes input from the sensors. A Type A to Type B USB connector links the wristband to a computer for data transfer and power supply. The Arduino is programmed to control the LEDs based on posture data processed by OpenCV and MediaPipe, which analyze live video feed from the system’s webcam. This seamless integration of hardware and software ensures that users receive prompt and accurate feedback, helping them to maintain proper posture and reduce the risk of posture-related issues.

```python
const int led = LED_BUILTIN;
char msg;


void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  pinMode(led, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(led, LOW);
}

void loop() {
  if (Serial.available() > 0) {
    msg = Serial.read();
    Serial.println(msg);
    
    if (msg == '1'){
      digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
      delay(500);
    }

    else if (msg == '0') {
      digitalWrite(led, LOW);
      for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
        digitalWrite(led, HIGH);
        delay(100);
        digitalWrite(led, LOW);
        delay(100);
        }
    }

    else {
      digitalWrite(led, LOW);
      delay(10000);
    }
  } else {
    digitalWrite(led, LOW);
  }

}
```
# HardwareIntegration

To integrate the software and hardware modules of our posture correction system, we employed a Type A to Type B USB connector. This connector serves as a link between the Arduino wristband and the computer, enabling data transfer and power supply. 

Our software development utilized a combination of the Arduino IDE and Python. The main project was developed in Python, where we facilitated communication between Python and Arduino using the PySerial library. PySerial enables serial communication between Python and Arduino, allowing seamless interaction between the Python codebase and the Arduino hardware.

This setup ensures effective coordination and control between the software and hardware components. The Python code captures real-time video feed using OpenCV, processes it with MediaPipe to extract keypoints and analyze posture, and then sends the posture data to the Arduino via the USB connection. The Arduino, in turn, controls the LEDs based on the received posture data, providing immediate feedback to the user. This integration is crucial for the real-time functionality of the posture correction system, ensuring that users receive prompt and accurate alerts to maintain proper posture.
